## How to Use, The Basics (Because We Have to Start Somewhere)
<p><strong>Generating Links: 🚀</strong></p>

<p>For an individual message, it's a breeze! Simply use a simple forward or send the message to the bot's private chat, and voila, the link is ready!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Single Message:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Forward the message to the bot.</li>
      <li>Receive the magic link! 🪄✨</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>But wait, there's more! For multiple file batching, send <code>/batch</code> in the bot's private chat. Choose from two options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Batch from Channel:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Batch up to 100 messages directly from your channel.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Batch from Message:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Batch up to 10 messages from your chat.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
