 * @description
 * Directory Purpose:
 * 
 * This script/files in this folder, each representing a module for
 * handling updates from the Telegram bot, such as new messages or callback queries.
 *
 * Each module is expect a function that takes a 'client' object as its
 * argument. The 'client' represents the Telegram bot, and each module may perform
 * specific actions in response to incoming updates and Function returns `0` to indicate
 * a successful execution or expected completion of the task.
 * 
 * Note: It's important to handle error cases appropriately and return values other than 0
 * to indicate specific failure conditions. This helps the calling code to differentiate
 * between successful and unsuccessful outcomes, allowing for effective error handling.
 * 
 * The purpose of this script is to dynamically handle a variety of messages
 * and queries without requiring manual registration of each module.
